Welcome to my first ever terminal only repo, not only on github, but ever. this is my first time using Git CLI rather than github desktop which is more of a cheet sheet. In industry, it is gernerally not used because of how heavy it is compared to a command line version. Also, its better to learn the commands, rather than having a simple gui do it for you ;)
